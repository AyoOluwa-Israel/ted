                            There’s been a lot of talks lately about the future of education: is education steering
                            towards skill or degree? Which of these do you think the future world would support? What is
                            sustainable education and how do we create it? In this post, we would look into what
                            sustainable education is, lay bare how sustainability can be adopted in the educational
                            system, and finally decide on what the future of education would be; Skills or Degree?
                            Let’s scrap in and get going.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p><span class="red">What is Sustainable Education?</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            First, sustainable education is not the same thing as education for sustainability which is
                            about teaching the cores of sustainability. Sustainable education is kinda practical. It is
                            about finding long-lasting solutions to social, environmental, and economic issues. I will
                            say, this is about using whatever kind of education you have to proffer sustainable
                            solutions to pressing issues in our communities. Education in this case could be our degrees
                            or skills we have learned and developed.Now that we have understood what sustainable
                            education is, I need you to think about how we can achieve this. Will our degrees, lessons
                            learned in school do the job, or do we need some saving grace called skills? A degree or
                            skills? How would we proffer long-lasting solutions to our society's pressing needs?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p><span class="red">Degree or Skills</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Now that we have understood what sustainable education is, I need you to think about how we
                            can achieve this. Will our degrees, lessons learned in school do the job, or do we need some
                            saving grace called skills? A degree or skills? How would we proffer long-lasting solutions
                            to our society's pressing needs?
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <div class="img-cont">
                        </div>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p>However, the students of the 21st century are expected to develop and grow higher-order
                            thinking skills, engaging knowledge in flexible and creative ways. They are also required to
                            demonstrate advanced scientific thinking, analyze conflicting evidence, and make calculated
                            and informed decisions to solve a wide variety of real-life problems.
                            In addition, to solve pressing issues in society, they are needed to develop higher-order
                            social skills in order to collaborate and negotiate with other people, and respect social
                            diversity. They need to develop communication and literacy skills, allowing them to process
                            information.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            It is widely known that companies are looking for individuals who know their onions and
                            hiring managers tend to put skills above your degree. Is this really so? Have you ever come
                            across a job post that needed a certain type of degree to have an edge? Take a writing
                            freelancing gig as a case study, writing skills can be developed but then, most clients
                            appreciate those with a Bachelor in English, Arts, or even Communication.
                        </p>
                        <br>
                        <br>
                        <p><span class="red">What would be your choice? Degree, Skills or both?</span>
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            In sustainable education, students acquire what is necessary and useful to address their
                            own, and society’s, present and future needs: students acquire these competencies to
                            full-blown, sustainable levels, that is, to an extent that the competencies are truly
                            incorporated and can be further developed later on in life.
                            <br>
                            <br>
                            Conclusively, the future of education will be to incorporate both soft and industry-required
                            skills into our orthodox educational structure, that is, while we pursue a degree, we add
                            skills to it. Let me tell you something you can start doing.
                            TedX is a program of self-organized events that bring people together to share technology,
                            entertainment, and design-like experiences. To achieve this, it will require the
                            collaboration of different people. It will also provide a space to learn and build some of
                            these skills. You should consider joining our volunteer family to get started.
